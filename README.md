# ML Utility Functions Repository 
This repository contains my utility modules used in machine learning workflow for data loading, preprocessing, visualization, machine learning training, and evaluation. These modules are designed to streamline and simplify the common tasks involved in building and evaluating machine learning models. 
## Data Loading
The data_loading module contains functions for loading and preprocessing data. This includes functions for reading and transforming data stored in various formats, such as CSV, TFRecord, and images. 
## Preprocessing 
The preprocessing folder contains modules with functions for transforming and cleaning data. This includes functions for handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical variables. 
## Visualization 
The visualization folder contains modules with functions for visualizing data and model performance. This includes functions for plotting data distributions, creating confusion matrices, and generating ROC curves. 
## ML Model Training 
The training folder contains modules with functions for training machine learning models. This includes functions for splitting data into training and validation sets, performing grid searches, and saving and loading trained models. 
## Evaluation
The evaluation folder contains modules with functions for evaluating the performance of machine learning models. This includes functions for calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, and generating reports summarizing model performance.  Usage
